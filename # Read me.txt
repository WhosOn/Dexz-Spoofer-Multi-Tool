1. Reinstall your Windows entirely ( Remember if you are in Windows 11, you'll have to go back to Windows 10, Due to Win 11 Forcing TPM 2.0)

1.5. Make sure you have the fresh install, then follow along with the rest!!!

2. Make sure TPM 2.0 is off in bios, Same Shit with secure boot, and if you have it (gigabyte) "TPK/PTK" (Optional).

2.5. Flash BIOS, For Cringy Prebuilt ASUS users, upgrade/downgrade for your specific motherboard. But if you dont have ASUS you can simply use the same Bios Version. Bios Example: F10 (Gigabyte Z390 Elite)

3. Change serials (DMIEDIT/AMIDEWIN) Change System Serial Number, UUID, and Mobo Serial Number.

4. Use Hard Disk Serial Number Changer/Volume Id, and change C: Drive or if you want all disks.

5. Change Your Mac Address, *I have included a free public spoofer by yours truly*
